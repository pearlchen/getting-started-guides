## Install prerequisite software

Depending on your computer's operating system, you may need to install additional software in order to use the dev kit version of Eclipse.


### Install 7Zip (Windows only)

[7zip](http://www.7-zip.org) supports extended file paths which some of the contents of the compressed file have so only use 7zip software to extract the file. [View detailed instructions »](details-install_7zip.md)

### Install Java

Eclipse depends on either a Java Runtime Engine (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK). Check if you have Java installed and, if you do not, install it. [View detailed instructions »](details-install_java.md)

## Extract Intel® IoT dev kit Eclipse IDE

Get the latest [Eclipse IDE for Intel® IoT](http://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/downloads) development. Download the compressed archive containing the customized IDE and extract the contents to your computer. **Important Note:** Windows users _must_ use **7-zip** for extraction.
