## Share your computer's WiFi connection (optional)

Turn on Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) to cut down on Wi-Fi traffic in a crowded room. Sharing your computer's internet connection also means that you can log into networks that have HTML password pages and then share the connection with the Intel® Edison.

Internet sharing is an optional step but is highly recommended if you are at a hackathon.

1. Open your **Network Connections** again.

2. **Right-click** on the "**Wi-Fi**" network adapter entry, then select "**Properties**".

3. Select the "**Sharing**" tab. 

4. Check "**Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection**" to enable Internet Connection Sharing (ICS).

5. Click "**Ok**". 

6. You will receive an alert about enabling ICS. Click "**Yes**" to continue.

Enabling ICS may have changed the IPv4 LAN settings you set in the previous section. Follow the steps in [Add static IPv4 address](#add-static-ipv4-address) to confirm that "Use the following IP address" is still set to "192.168.2.2".

7. Unplug and replug the device mode micro-USB cable to reset the Ethernet over USB connection.

8. Use PuTTY to establish a serial connection to the Intel® Edison.
  
  _Don't know how? Refer to [Shell Access](/shell_access/windows/serial_connection.md)._

9. On your Intel® Edison, disconnect from any WiFi networks the board might be logged into using the wireless command line interface (`wpa_cli`) command:

  ```
  wpa_cli disconnect
  ```

10. Then use the `route` command to add a default gateway. Use the same static IPv4 address you set in the **Network Connections** LAN settings in the previous section.

  ```
  route add default gw 192.168.2.2
  ```

You can now use the Intel® Edison as if it is connected to the internet on its own as long as you keep the device mode micro-USB cable plugged in.

Try pinging a network from PuTTY to make sure the Intel® Edison is connected to the internet through your computer's network connection:

```
ping google.com
```

(Use the Ctrl+C keyboard command to exit the ping process.)

To re-enable WiFi on the Intel® Edison, use the `configure_edison --wifi` command as described in [Connect Your Intel Edison to Wi-Fi](/connectivity/wifi/connect.md).

### Troubleshooting 

Unable to ping anything from the Intel® Edison?

* Unplug and replug the device mode micro-USB cable to reset the Ethernet over USB connection.
* Turn your computer's WiFi connections off, then back on.
* Restart your computer.
* Check that the IP address set in the IPv4 LAN settings is "192.168.2.2"
