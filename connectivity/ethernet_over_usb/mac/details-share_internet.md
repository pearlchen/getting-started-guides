## Share your computer's WiFi connection (optional)

Turn on Internet Sharing to cut down on Wi-Fi traffic in a crowded room. Sharing your computer's internet connection also means that you can log into networks that have HTML password pages and then share the connection with the Intel® Edison.
Internet sharing is an optional step but is highly recommended if you are at a hackathon.

1. Open your **Sharing** preference settings.
  (i.e. In the OS X menu bar, choose ![Mac OS icon](/icons/os_icon_mac.png) → System Preferences → Sharing)

2. If "**Internet Sharing**" is currently checked in the lefthand services list, **uncheck it** in order to make changes to your Mac Sharing settings.

3. Select "**Wi-Fi**" from the "**Share your connection from**" dropdown list, if not already selected.

4. Check "**Edison**" under "**To computers using**".

5. Enable sharing by checking "**Internet Sharing**" in the lefthand services list.

6. You will see a warning. Click "**Start**" to continue.

7. Unplug and replug the device mode micro-USB cable to reset the Ethernet over USB connection.

8. Use Terminal to establish a serial connection to the Intel® Edison.

  _Don't know how? Refer to [Shell Access](/shell_access/mac/serial_connection.md)._

9. On your Intel® Edison, disconnect from any WiFi networks the board might be logged into using the wireless command line interface (`wpa_cli`) command:

  ```
  wpa_cli disconnect
  ```

10. Then use the `route` command to add a default gateway. Use the same static IP address you set in the **Network** settings in the previous section.

  ```
  route add default gw 192.168.2.2
  ```

You can now use the Intel® Edison as if it is connected to the internet on its own as long as you keep the device mode micro-USB cable plugged in.

Try pinging a network from Terminal to make sure the Intel® Edison is connected to the internet through your computer's network connection:

```
ping google.com
```

(Use the Ctrl+C keyboard command to exit the ping process.)

To re-enable WiFi on the Intel® Edison, use the `configure_edison --wifi` command as described in [Connect Your Intel Edison to Wi-Fi](/connectivity/wifi/connect.md).

### Troubleshooting 

Unable to ping anything from the Intel® Edison?

* Unplug and replug the device mode micro-USB cable to reset the Ethernet over USB connection.
* Turn your computer's WiFi connections off, then back on.
* Restart your computer.
* Check that the IP address set in the IPv4 LAN settings is "192.168.2.2"
