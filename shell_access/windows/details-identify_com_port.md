1. Open Device Manager.

  _Don't know how? Refer to [Confirm Drivers → Open Device Manager](../../computer_setup/windows/confirm_drivers.md#open-windows-device-manager)._

2. Scroll down to the "**Ports (COM & LPT)**" section.

3. **Make a note of your COM #** for the "**USB Serial Port**" device. 

  Do ***not*** use the COM number for "Intel Edison USB Composite Device" or "Intel Edison Virtual Com Port". Those are for other features.

  Use the COM # shown on ***your*** computer's Device Manager. In the screenshot, it is "COM3" but your computer will have unique COM port number assignments and may be different from the screenshot.

### Troubleshooting 

**Don't see a "USB Serial Port" device listed?**

* **Do you have the serial drivers installed?**
  * A serial connection cannot be detected without FTDI serial drivers. Refer to [Set Up Your Computer - Windows (64-bit integrated installer)](../../computer_setup/windows/64bit_integrated_installer.md) or [Set Up Your Computer - Windows (manual installation)](../../computer_setup/windows/manual_installation.md).

* **Do you have the UART/serial cable connected?** Refer to [UART/serial micro-USB cable](../../assembly/arduino_expansion_board/details-serial_cable.md).

* Is your IoT board powered on?
