## Establish a serial connection

Use the Screen utility that you installed in the previous section to gain command line access of your IoT board. For example: `sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`

---

1. Open a new Terminal window.

2. Connect to the USB serial device using Screen.

  ```
  sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
  ```

  * "115200" indicates the baud rate. Always use 115200.

  * You may be asked for your root password. Type in your root password and press Enter.

3. When you see a blank screen, **press the Enter key**. 

  **For Intel® Edison boards running older firmware**: You may need to press the Enter key **twice**.

4. Once connected you will see a login prompt. 

  Type in "**root**" for the username and press **Enter**.

### Troubleshooting 

**Don't see a "usbserial" device listed?**

* **Do you have the UART/serial cable connected?** Refer to [UART/serial micro-USB cable](../../assembly/arduino_expansion_board/details-serial_cable.md).

* Is your IoT board powered on?
