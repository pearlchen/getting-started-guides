### Upload and run the application

Upload the project files to the IoT device and run it. Remember that every time you make changes to files and you want to see the changes: (1) save the file, (2) upload, (3) run.

1. In the bottom toolbar, click the "**Upload**" icon to upload the current project to the device.

**Get a "cannot find module mraa" message?**

If you see this error message, your board is missing libmraa, a library for GPIO communication on Linux platforms. 
Connect to your IoT board via serial or SSH. Then run the following commands: 

```
echo "src mraa-upm http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/1.1/intelgalactic" > /etc/opkg/mraa-upm.conf
opkg update
opkg install libmraa0
```

The first command will edit the mraa-upm config file on the board. The last two commands use the board's built-in Opkg package manager to download and update the missing library.

After updating the MRAA libraries, return to the Intel® XDK. Click the "Run" icon again to re-run the project on the device.

Look at your Intel® IoT board for a blinking light.

* **Intel® Galileo Gen 2**
  
  A green LED is located near the USB port.

* **Intel® Edison**
  
  The LED is located near the center of the board.

**Congratulations, you just ran your first Intel® XDK application!**
