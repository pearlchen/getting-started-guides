  The integrated installer is unable to detect your Intel® Edison. Ensure that the board is powered on and plugged into your computer via the device mode micro-USB port on the expansion board.

  Otherwise you will need to install the Windows drivers manually. Go to [Set Up Your Computer - Windows (manual installation) »](manual_installation.md)
