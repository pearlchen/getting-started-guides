## Step 3: Flash the image

Run the `reboot ota` command on the Intel® Edison to flash the board with the files you copied over in Step 2.

1. Establish a serial connection to the Intel® Edison.

  _Don't know how? Refer to [Shell Access](/shell_access/)._

2. Use the `reboot ota` command to reboot the Intel® Edison from the command line.

  **Note:** This will erase everything on your Intel® Edison including configuration settings such as the board's username and password.

  ```
  reboot ota
  ```

3. Your Intel® Edison will reboot and begin the flashing process with the latest image.

4. When the Intel® Edison is done flashing, you should see the login prompt.

If the firmware flash was successful, you should now be able to use the `configure_edison` command with the `--version` flag.

```
configure_edison --version
```

If the output is "120" (or higher, depending on how up to date this document is), you have successfully flashed your board!

**No "configure_edison --version" option? Don't see "120" (or higher) outputted as the build version number?**

Your board was not updated with the latest image.

* Incomplete zip downloads may cause issues. Re-download the "Yocto complete image" zip file from Intel® Edison Boards and Compute Modules - Software Downloads and try again from [Step 1: Prepare built-in flash storage](manually.md#step-1-prepare-built-in-flash-storage).

* **Mac users only:** If re-downloading a new zip does not fix the issues, you can try the "Alternate Flashing Method" described at the bottom of [Intel Edison Flashing Firmware on OS X - Wired](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-edison-flashing-firmware-on-os-x-wired).
